## About Datsun

Datsun is a automobile brand with a rich history that spans over a century. Originally established in Japan, the brand has gone through several significant phases of evolution and market presence.

## Generations

### First Generation: Early Years (1911-1933)

Datsun originated in 1911 when Kaishinsha Motor Car Works was founded in Tokyo, Japan. The first car named "DAT" was introduced in 1914, with the name being an acronym formed from the surnames of the company's three investors: Kenjiro Den, Rokuro Aoyama, and Meitaro Takeuchi. The small car called "Datson" (meaning "Son of DAT") was introduced in 1931, later changed to "Datsun" to avoid negative connotations, as "son" also means "loss" in Japanese.

### Second Generation: Pre-War and Post-War Expansion (1934-1959)

In 1934, Datsun became part of Nissan Motor Company. During this period, Datsun produced affordable family cars based on Austin designs, establishing itself as a key player in the Japanese automotive market. After World War II, Datsun resumed production and began expanding its presence, particularly with the introduction of the Datsun 110 series in the early 1950s.

### Third Generation: International Growth (1960-1981)

The 1960s and 1970s marked Datsun's global expansion and peak popularity. The brand made significant inroads into international markets, particularly in the United States. Iconic models from this era include the Datsun 510 (Bluebird) and the Datsun 240Z (Fairlady Z), which established the brand's reputation for affordable, sporty, and reliable vehicles. The 1973 oil crisis further boosted Datsun's popularity as consumers sought fuel-efficient alternatives to American cars.

### Fourth Generation: Transition to Nissan (1981-1986)

In 1981, Nissan announced plans to phase out the Datsun name globally. This transition period saw vehicles dual-branded as Datsun and Nissan until the Datsun name was completely phased out by 1986. The corporate decision aimed to strengthen the Nissan brand globally and reduce marketing costs associated with maintaining two separate brand identities.

### Fifth Generation: Revival (2013-2022)

After nearly three decades of absence, Nissan revived the Datsun brand in 2013 as an entry-level marque for emerging markets including India, Indonesia, Russia, and South Africa. The revival focused on producing affordable cars for first-time buyers in developing economies. Notable models included the Datsun Go, Go+, and redi-GO. However, Nissan announced in 2022 that it would again discontinue the Datsun brand as part of its global restructuring plan.
